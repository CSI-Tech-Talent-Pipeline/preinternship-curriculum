In this lecture I want to make sure that we:
- install json-server globally
- add a `db.json` file to our project and add jobs to it
- implement functions that use async/await syntax to fetch data from our database
- implement the `useEffect` hook to fetch the jobs from our database
- implement the `useEffect` hook in our modal component to attach a keyboard event listener to allow closing the modal by clicking the escape key (to demo cleanup function as well)
- add persistence to the form that creates new job postings so they are saved to the database as well.
